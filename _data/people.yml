- name: Padraig Gleeson
  title: Principal Research Fellow 
  abstract: Dr. Gleeson's work focuses on the development of tools and standards to facilitate the generation, analysis and sharing of models of neuronal systems. He developed <a href="https://www.neuroconstruct.org"><b>neuroConstruct</b></a>, an open source graphical application for constructing and analysing 3D networks of biophysically detailed neurons. <br/>He is also the main technical contributor to the <a href="/research#neuroml"><b>NeuroML</b></a> language for simulator independent model descriptions in neuroscience. He is leading development of the <a href="/research#osb"><b>Open Source Brain</b></a> repository which aims to facilitate the sharing of data in neuroscience and the collaborative development of neuronal models in an open source environment. <br/>His research activities include investigation of information processing in cerebellar and cortical microcircuits. He is also Project Director of the <a href="/research#openworm"><b>OpenWorm project</b></a>, which aims to create an <i>in-silico</i>, cell by cell model of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>. <br/>More recently he has co-founded an international collaboration, <a href="/research#mdf"><b>ModECI (Model Exchange and Convergence Initiative)</b></a>, which aims to unify representations of computational models across the fields computational neuroscience, cognitive science and machine learning.
