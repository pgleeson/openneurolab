<h2>Open Source Brain</h2>

<a href="https://www.opensourcebrain.org">Open Source Brain</a> is a web based platform for sharing computational models and experimental data in neuroscience. It promotes open, collaborative development of data-driven models of neural systems. Standards are used to ensure accessibility and reusability - NeuroML for models and NeuroData Without Borders for data.

<h2>NeuroML</h2>
<a href="https://www.neuroml.org">NeuroML</a> is a specification language for building and exchanging models of neurons and circuits, ranging from simple integrate and fire point neurons, to 3D networks of morphologically detailed multicompartmental cell models.

<h2>OpenWorm</h2>
The <a href="https://www.openworm.org">OpenWorm project</a> is global collaboration to create an open source, cell-by-cell computer simulation of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>. A simulation of the nervous system of the worm in NeuroML format has been linked to a 3D model of the body of the worm which can interact with a simulated external environment.

<h2>MDF - Model Description Format</h2>
The motivation for <a href="https://mdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/QuickStart.html">MDF - Model Description Format</a> was the fact that neural networks were being used across computational neuroscience, machine learning and cognitive science to describe how networks process information. The MDF language, being developed by <a href="https://modeci.org">ModECI (Model Exchange and Convergence Initiative)</a>, is intended to be a unifying way to describe models across all of these disciplines.
